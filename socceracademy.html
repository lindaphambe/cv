  <h2>DIASPORA SOCCER ACADEMY</h2>
  <p>
    <h4>I founded DIASPORA SOCCER ACADEMY, The Diaspora Academy is a program initiated towards youth soccer and netball skills development and has become a home to many young people aspiring to be professional athletes in their sporting codes. It was
      formed in 2012, incorporated and registered in July 2016. Intakes for the academy start at the age of 9 and by the age of 18 we expect that these athletes will have moved on to bigger clubs.
      Our coaches and staff are our pride and are very passionate, skilled and experienced volunteers who love what they do. Our football coaches have played in local upper division leagues which is great for their experience and knowledge sharing
      with the youngsters.
      Education is key at our academy and we encourage our athletes to commit to their studies in equal measure to their sports quest. We also offer the older willing players coaching and or refereeing training to increase their options within the
      sport business. As a result, we have partnered with the Kensington Secondary School, which registers our players and also allow us to use their facilities for training and matches.
      The vast majority of our players, boys and girls, have the passion and are determined to succeed but they are from socially challenged backgrounds and communities in the Southern African region. As a result, they are not in a positions to
      cover the Annual registration fee, let alone afford basic training equipment such as boots, training shoes, shin pads, transport to and from training and league matches.
      Our aim is to be the best model academy in South Africa that offers academic, sporting and social skills excellence in the short term, and in the long term be the academy of choice for young athletes.</h4>

  <h3>VALUES</h3>
  <b>Below is the core values that we aspire to live by and pass on to our athletes;</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Integrity</li>
    <li>Excellence</li>
    <li>Respect</li>
    <li>Fair play</li></br>
  </ol>
  The reason that I have chosen these four (4) is that they are fundamental to the game of football at all levels of the game. They also are essential characteristics in life in general, which makes for well-rounded human beings on and off the
  pitch.
